## My Computing Setups
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand.</summary>

I currently operate three systems: two desktop computers and a laptop.

### Primary Desktop
Specifications: 
- Intel® Core™ i7 14700K processor
- GeForce RTX™ 4060 Ti VENTUS 2X BLACK 16G OC graphics card
- 32 GB DDR5 RAM clocked at 5200 MT/s
- MSI MAG A850GL PCIE5 Power Supply Unit, offering 850W, 80 Plus Gold certification, and full modularity
- Storage: Crucial P2 1TB 3D NAND NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD paired with a Western Digital SN730 NVMe SSD
- Case: Ant Esports Crystal X4

### Secondary Desktop
- Laptop: [Victus by HP 16.1 inch Gaming Laptop PC 16-e0000 (2V8Z7AV)](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/details/victus-by-hp-16.1-inch-gaming-laptop-pc-16-e0000/2100371512)
  - This system has been relegated to secondary status due to its unreliable performance and poor build quality. It frequently idles at 85 degrees Celsius and crashes under load.

### Server
My server is underutilized but hosts essential utilities such as:
- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
- It mainly functions as a NAS.
